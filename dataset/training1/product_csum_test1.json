     "text": "Time is fast, and I have been buying a car for almost a year. Due to the epidemic, I control the boundary of my travel. I can only use cars in this city. When I use the most cars, I only go to work on the way to work.The rest of the time is at home. At present, I only drive 10,000 kilometers to maintain it twice. I feel sorry for the oil, but there is no way to maintain it once in half a year.You, because you do n’t care if you give it 3 times for maintenance, it ’s free. If you have any questions, I’ m not maintained in time. At that time, it ’s the problem of the owner. Through the 10,000 kilometers of cars in the past two years, I will share my real feelings today.For everyone, make a reference for the new car owners who are ready to buy a car!I. Introduction to the vehicle Introduction I was the two -wheel drive urban version of Honda CRV1.5T, which was mentioned on July 15, 21, with a price of 190,800 naked cars, a purchase tax of 16,800, 4,500 insurance, and a full landing of 213,000. At that time, the discount was only 12,000. At presentThe Honda CRV discount is relatively high, and the terminal discounts are still 20,000.2. The use of the vehicle has been driving for 100,000 kilometers from nowadays, and it is quite satisfactory from the first 100 kilometers to 8.5L to 8.5L. I basically use the car to get off work in the suburbs and take the car in the city. After get off work, high -speed will not run, and the less fuel consumption will be higher in mileage. If you always run the high speed, it will be lower.Third, the vehicle's appearance and the old CRV formation is more suitable for both commercial and home use. It is completely different than the style of the new model. It gives people a feeling of successful people.The siege has become more connotative, and is loved by men 70, 80, and later.Fourth, the interior of the CRV of the vehicle cannot be said to be fashionable technology. It can only be said that it is simple and atmospheric. I can't see the existence of the sense of technology, but the feeling of using it is OK. My favorite is the design of the CRV.The feeling of the aircraft gear rod is very comfortable, and the keys are clear and well operated.V. Auxiliary function is easy to use 1.CRV with a pre -collision system, brake assist function, cruise system, lane departure reminder, automatic air conditioning, etc., so that drivers can ensure driving safety during driving and help driving.Very intimate and easy to use.6. The wheelbase of the space performance CRV is 2661mm. From the data, the model of the same level is smaller, but it is actually enough. I am 1.73 meters tall.The performance of the box is really good, especially the rear seats are placed in a pure flat. It is no problem to put a few large suitcases casually, and this is more humane.The frame and side door storage can be said to be quite perfect for CRV on the space.Seven, the fuel consumption economy, as a household SUV fuel consumption performance, is a necessary condition for many car owners to choose a car. The low fuel consumption that CRV is fully done. Driving 718L in the suburbs of the car after get off work. The overall performance of 9L in the urban area is still very satisfied. The fuel consumption performance of the same CRV and the 2.0 hybrid version is lower. With the assistance of the motor, it can control the fuel consumption well. It is from me. It is the Northeast region. The problem of lustering the oil and oil of the previous noisy oil made me discouraged. Finally, the 1.5T fuel version was selected. Although the fuel consumption is higher than the hybrid, it is stable. EssenceSeven, disadvantages vomiting 1. Starting and stop chicken ribs: Many car owners talk about the start and suspension of the vehicle, and the CRV is also very troublesome to turn off the start and stop in advance.Effect, but frequent start -up vehicles will cause losses to the starter and battery. Although the enhanced boot motors and batteries are used, the price is twice as much as possible than the ordinary type. This is three to three times the price.That is why many car owners get off the reasons for starting and stopping the start and stop. The saving oil is not enough to buy the battery!You have to lose.2. The lights are not bright: The CRV is standard for LED headlights. It looks very tall and the actual brightness is not as good as halogen headlights!Many times when driving at night, I ca n’t see the things in front of them. If it encounters a rainy day and no lights, the high beam is a little worse than that of near the light, so many riders have modified the headlights after buying CRV.Safety is much clearer. It is recommended to modify driving safety if you often take the night road.3. Interior: At present, many car companies pay more attention to the sense of technology and advanced of the interior. Especially domestic cars are in place, and the joint venture car is not so arbitrary.Novelty, very old -fashioned, especially the small screen and instrument disk plus a large screen with no domestic cars, and many places in low -to -medium -match models use weaving and plastic, which is simply comparable to the joint venture.4. Noise: CRV's noise is not a single source, but the noise of the whole vehicle is very large. For example, as long as the tire noise is over 60, it is clear to hear the contact between the tire and the ground.Inside the car, it shows that the sound insulation of the vehicle is not very good. If you do n’t have money, you can do the whole car's sound insulation.5. Soft lacquer: When it comes to Japanese cars, many riders will talk about the problem of soft iron and thin car paint. CRV will also press a pit with a little side door.The small stone that can fly up casually can smash the primer. It is recommended that there is a layer of car jacket for obsessive -compulsive disorder to protect it.Summary: Although there are many disadvantages, each car has its essence. Buying what you like is the most important. There is no perfect person, no perfect car. If you like it, you can accept it.The disadvantage is that I hope to make a reference for the riders who are going to buy a car. I will continue to share my car experience in the future. I hope everyone will discuss it together![Thank you for being happy forever L recommendation] ### Honda CR-V",

I have been with the car for a year, and I have been on the car that I chose with thousands of choices.The car is made of an annual summary, and at the same time, the brothers in the car are referenced.I personally think that the main factors such as their own budget, car needs, brand preferences, appearance, and space are mainly selected.My scope of car selection is 22-- 27W. After many comparisons, I finally chose Cadillac XT4. Technical type. Advantages: 1. Domineering appearance, in line with my aesthetics of the car.The exquisite vehicle system is smooth, and all can be seen with leather coverage. It is not luxurious or shabby.2. The power can fully meet my requirements for the car. The full 2.0T plus 9AT is more kind. If you step on it, the overtaking is full of confidence and confident.3. The sound insulation is better, the long -distance is very comfortable, the quality of the driving is better, and the minimum configuration can also meet my basic needs. I personally think that the technical audio can also be better. The second -collar version is better.The price range is very cost -effective, the materials are thick, and the paint surface is relatively thick.Disadvantages: 1. I think the brakes are softer, and the sudden brakes are a little confident.2. There is no automatic parking, and there are no 22 models.3. The assembly process is average, the position of the electronic handbrake is not smooth, but now it is used to it.Summary: There is no one person, there is no car for a car, its advantages can meet your car needs. It can tolerate its disadvantages, indicating that it is suitable for your good car. I choose I like it.Select XT4 without hesitation.XT4 is suitable for people with a little petty bourgeoisie, but the price of more than 200,000 yuan is really not a luxury car, but it is just a common people who can afford a ride.Because the epidemic has a long time because of the recent long time, will you lose electricity for a long time?

     "text": "Still adhere to the way of \"the golden mean\", there is no surprise -a test drive 21 A8L50TFSIQUATTRO comfortable type This test drive is 21 Audi A8L50TFSIQUATTRO comfortable type. As a BMW 7 Series owner, combined with the previous test drive Mercedes -Benz S350,Compare these three cars, just feel at all for your reference.I often drive the 19 BMW's 19 modified 730Li, which has run more than 6,000 kilometers, of which most of them are high.As a luxury D -class car, although it is an entry -level model of the BMW 7 Series, the configuration is sufficient, and the seat ventilation and remote startup are selected to meet daily use.The seat support is in place.Although it is a 4 -cylinder of the engine, the power is absolutely sufficient, and the high -speed throttle response is positive.The chassis is stable, the steering wheel is accurate, and the air suspension can filter a large amplitude of the road surface, providing people in the car.The disadvantage is that the frustration of low speed during the second gear is changed in the second gear. The engine sound is relatively large when the cold car starts, and the trunk volume is a bit small.During this time, some feelings of driving 730.Next, let's talk about the feeling of the ADID A8L.The appearance of 21 Audi A8 has basically changed its appearance compared to the previous one.The huge hexagonal grille is the largest intake grille in these three cars. For the entire front face of A8L, the straight lines used and the most powerful sense of strength.Compared with the movement of the 7 Series and the beauty of S, the entire side has a thick sense of Audi A8, and it feels more solid with people.The lack of appearance is that the entire front face is too similar to A6, and it is not easy to distinguish at a glance.Compared to the previous one, there are two points in the interior.The first is the increase in the diamond pattern of the seat, and the luxury of the entire interior has improved; the second point is to increase the shift paddles, and the driving fun has improved (it is estimated that there are very few opportunities in the future).The whole interior is that A8 feels simple. One is to cancel most of the physical buttons of the central control, and the other is the piano paint of the entire central control.Compared to the 7 Series, the feeling of interior is better and more fashionable.What I want to vomit is the upper and lower screens of the central control. I really can't like it. The central control screen is originally lower than the 7 Series and S, and then there is a screen controlled by the central control screen.The accuracy and ease of use in the process are poor, which also greatly affects the safety of driving.The second feeling is that the entire central control front desk is a fingerprint collector, which should be cleaned in time.For the entire rear row experience, neither the Audi A8 and the BMW 7 Series have the comfort of the package.However, the A8 rear seats feel lower than the 7 Series, and the ride feel is better.S> a8> 7 in the rear ride.A8L, like Mercedes -Benz S, is a 6 -cylinder engine used.During the driving process, the smoothness is better than 730.However, during the driving process, I felt that it was more meaty during the driving process, and it was not as accurate as the 7 series during the driving process.Although my car is 730 in 4 cylinders, the horsepower is 265 horsepower. Compared to the 6 -cylinder A8L50TFSIQUATTRO comfortable type, it is more than 20 horsepower.Strong, the power response is more positive.However, thanks to the housekeeping skills of the Audi Quattro four -wheel drive, the grabbing of A8 during the exercise process is more firm.During the entire driving process, the 7 Series will basically give feedback on the conditions of the road. Although the comfort is greatly improved compared to the previous generation, the suspension feels relatively hard.S is to filter most of the pavement feedback, and it feels like a bit of boat.A8 gives me a feeling that the two are better than the 7 series.The new A8L has not changed greatly compared to the previous model. Although it has just been listed, 4S stores now have 20 points of discounts.Compared with the Mercedes -Benz S -Class, there is a lack of atmosphere, and the interior does not have the luxury of S. It is not as far away as the BMW 7 Series in terms of sports personality.Overall, it is still the \"moderate\" road.However, with the youthfulness and personalization of users, the challenges facing A8 will become larger and larger, and the moderate route may no longer be suitable for the current market competition.The three cars I test drive are the minimum of their respective models, so the comparability is relatively high.For the recommended car purchase suggestions for these three cars, if you have a compact budget, and most of them are driving by yourself, the BMW 730 is definitely the best for you.If you are pursuing stability and comfort, my suggestion is Mercedes -Benz S.For A8, the budget is compact and has 4 cylinders. This is the best choice. My overall feeling that A8 is between the 7 Series and S, there is no 7 sports without S. In short, you are comfortable. In short, youIf you buy an A8, it seems to make others unable to pick any problems, which is the \"golden mean\" of A8.Because the A8 test drive time is short, I only talk about the feeling of my test drive. I hope everyone will include it.### Audi A8",

Usually, public transportation at work is very convenient, and it is close to the unit.After understanding, I found that the second -hand car water was too deep, so I gave up.Buy a new car, at least worry.The beginning of this year, all public transportation was suspended, and once again strengthened the idea of ​​buying a car.During the epidemic period, I was closed to work in the company, and I started to study cars after work.EssenceEssenceThe vehicle introduced some twists and turns, and finally took it -the 21 Mazda CX4 exploration version opened home.After landing 16.5, after 3000 after the subsidy of medical staff, the guidance price was basically landed.It was mentioned in Xuzhou next door. He ran home more than 300 kilometers on the same day -Henan Zhoukou.The process of buying a car is about cars. I did n’t understand before, so I tuned some car knowledge in detail.Determine the direction of car selection, SUV, do not dominate, do not double -clutch, do not have turbocharged, the budget is about 15.Friends heard that I want to buy a car and recommend golf. The advantages are still a lot. Golf is too small and double -clutch, PASS.Mitsubishi's Outlander feels too old, and it is a bit difficult to control his wife. Although there are new models, maybe this name is too long; Jinxuan naturally enters the field of vision.It does not have ESP, security considerations, and PASS.When hesitating, friends recommend steel wires. At first glance, they are very consistent in all aspects. Three major pieces, mechanical quality, control, safety, are good, especially the face value.After watching the car, I experienced the space problem and felt that it was enough. There were not too big people at home.When I was preparing to get 20 models in June, a large number of abnormal sounds suddenly broke out. I finally chose the car that I wish. When I didn't want to change it, I was preparing to take the 20 models.Wait, then 21 models were released in August. It is said that it was changed to solve the abnormal noise. I watched whether there was abnormal noise for a few months. I did not hear the 20 parades of abnormal noise.The car's experience has only one local auto trade with existing cars. I went to see the offer 7K, insurance 4K, and loan fees of 2K.The real car also watched, the price also understood, the important person debuted, my cousin of my country.In the case of the situation, I heard that there were sesame sandalwood cars in Xuzhou, with a discount of 145,000, and the insurance store went out.Decisive, win, install 5.5, one and a half years, 16.5, and then subsidize 3,000, which is 16.2.Full 38 liters of oil on the day, and ran home at a high speed of more than 300 kilometers.The fuel consumption shows 6.5, and now less than two months, the fuel consumption is 7.1, which is very satisfied.In the initial car, I felt the appearance. From the perspective of the front body of the body, it was very heavy, and the lines on the hood were also beautiful.This car is not as thin as the online picture, and it looks very mighty in front. The soul -motion design is a major advantage of the Mazda brand. It combines the sports elements with the static body.Infinite passion, especially the design of the front of the car, there is a certain attack power, a strong layered full -stars inlet grille, silver Mazda logo, sharp Scorpio eye headlights are very beautiful scenery.I think there is still room for improvement in the interior. The vision is not luxurious.There is almost no odor in the car. Only the taste of the new fabric is not the odor. The taste is slightly obvious after the stop time.The function of the vehicle is not used too deeply, it is just tried. It is a bit rude. The voice control cannot reach the next level interface. It is very convenient for Baidu Carlife mobile phone to connect. It is easy to use when you get on the car.There is no fruit mobile phone without using CarPlay.The power performance is quite excellent. If you are not afraid of the oil, you will go down. There are still some pushing back.Called, the overtaking is clean and neat, the power output is very balanced and linear, which is more suitable for urban roads. The reaction of the throttle is very timely. There is obvious feedback on the accelerator. This is very good and very satisfactory.In addition, the oil price of No. 92 is also cheap, and it is not controlled during the running -in period. It only runs the high speed once, and it is basically controlled at about 120 and the high speed is more than 300 kilometers.Around L, there are many in the urban area, and the fuel consumption in the later period should rise.I do n’t know if the fuel consumption will decrease further after the running -in period. Considering that the displacement of 2.0L is also considered a large displacement, it is still satisfied with the fuel consumption performance.Disadvantages: The unsatisfactory places are mainly concentrated in the design and space design. The rear space of the Mazda CX4 does have some depression.There is no problem. For a long time, the legs will definitely feel uncomfortable. The head space of the rear row is not sufficient, mainly caused by the sliding back design of the external contour. This is the truth that fish and palms can not be available.The space measured my brother 1.85, 200 pounds. There is no problem in the front row. The back row is a bit compact. It is obviously not stretched. It is okay for a short time. It is definitely tired for a long time.Big pieces, there is nothing in space.There is also the function of one -click startup with this car but no keyless entry.The radio function is driven by the car by default, and it must be closed manually every time. Who knows how to close it permanently, please tell me.There is also the lacquer is really thin. Walking on the countryside, there are occasional bushes on the roadside to the road. I accidentally rush to the side of the car and get out of the car carefully. There are a few scratches.It is also uncomfortable.You can only drive carefully.In addition, the tire pressure alarm will not show specific tire pressure. Even the tires who call the police must get out of the car for inspection. If you are slow, you can't find it for a while.It accepted everything, and it was not concealed anyway.### Mazda CX-4",

I still care about the price of the joint venture brand.I will not talk about the car selection process. Finally, I chose 21 Pokémon 1.5 automatic beggar version of the beggar version. It landed 11.1.Advantage space: Ride space is quite satisfactory. If the seat is tuned at the top of the head ten centimeters, the front row is not as large as the main driving of the co -pilot leg space due to the slope of the instrument panel.The left and right spaces are limited. The Japanese cars are all flat at this position. The front and rear space adult riding distance from the front seat is also a punch. The trunk space is quite large., The trunk can be installed!This is the advantage of this car. There is very little space in the same level!Power and control: 1.5 The power can only be said to be able to run. It is no problem for mobility. Don't think about driving fun. You can only have driving passion with T or 2.0 or more.The rear suspension of this car is generally caused by the cornering.

The fuel consumption can reach more than 40. This national road and high -speed fuel saving the lowest fuel efficiency to 5.2. In addition to the fuel consumption, it usually occasionally washing the car is occasionally washing the car. I did n’t know how the maintenance costs did not reach the maintenance period.

Occasionally, there are soft bags in some places.Poor, although the beggars are also over 100,000 cars, the steering wheel is not multifunctional, and there is no reversing image. The vehicle does not support playing videos.The cigarette lighter is fake and not bright.

The extra fuel consumption cannot save a thousand yuan for a year.Another 380 compared with Magotan's entire car series in hardware and software, the price is the highest.Use car: The car has returned for more than ten days. I haven't driven it a few times, because the upgrade has delayed the in -depth test.However, the basic feeling can be shared with everyone, let's talk about the advantages first!1. The space is very large. I have not compared other B -class cars at the same price, such as Accord, Camry, Passat, etc., and the 20 Magotan spaces are very abundant, and there is no sense of depression in the rear row people.2.

There are noise at the start of the cold car. As for the specific sound, I can't say anything, anyway, the noise other than the sound of the engine.2. Waiting for the red and green lights to step on the brakes or parking, the slight vibration of the engine can be passed to the cab.3. Material materials for interior can be said to be very cut off, full of plastic sense.If the instrument table and door panel are simply wrapped in leather and then embellished with snacks. Although it is not luxurious, it is at least not cheap, especially at the armrest box, you can't make the armrest box larger?A little higher?This will have a full texture!4. The bumps on the road surface of the low -lying section are clearly passed to the cab, which means that the overall tuning is harder, which is a bit unavailable to the business car.5.

The three cars in the family are all five, and one belongs to a super -super, and is unwilling to drive MPV; so it takes a comprehensive to change to a 6 or 7 -seat SUV.My preferred goal at the time was Land Rover's new discovery ------ and just the only goal!Because, hey, men have a Land Rover complex!The high sitting position, the slowly rising air suspension, two powerful differential locks, plus 90cm's wading depth, the off -road e -tribe's car logo, leaving, buddy, tank base!So far, set the target in the HSE version of 3.0T. Select the seat ventilation and there is a rear box to sensor the key or something. The test drive twice.I was unaccustomed, but the real high feeling was good, and my wife was persuaded. At that time, I was still the National Five, and I had 610,000 to choose a naked car and gray. As a result, the gray car came to the car to pick up the car,As a result, the price was 640,000 less, and the most hated this kind of non -honest merchant, decisively left!Since the second half of 2019, the price trend discovered by the six of the country has been paying attention to the 4S shop.As a result, I accidentally saw Xia Dong's car program on the Internet ------- I saw his test drive in the United States-this car shape, haha, it's my dish!Immediately joined the flyer to my car change list!When it was about November, the local Lincoln 4S shop said that there was an imported version of the test drive, and he pulled his wife.In order to deepen the impression; I went to the test drive on the same day and found that I found that the pilot was tested; the two cars were compared with the personality characteristics, each with its own style.Land Rover found that the original intention of off -road also took into account the performance of highway; the pilot was exactly the luxurious road of the highway, and you could walk a slightly complicated road, but don't expect it to go off the off -road!In terms of appearance, my wife and I voted for the flyer's ticket, and the buttocks found that the buttocks were too hurtful.In terms of space, the two are not much different; just two rows of comfort, because the height of the second row of seats is too low like a small bench, which is not supported by the thighs; many people buy it.The seat (imported version) was not introduced at all, and the bulging in the middle made me not like it.Looking at the third row of seats, the third row of space discovered is slightly better than the pilot, but sacrificed the trunk space!When driving, I found that it feels more like a boat, but the feeling of highness is that I can't experience it on the pilot!Finally, the configuration is the same, and the pilot configuration is full and found several streets!SO and my wife and I think that the flyer is more suitable for my family!However, at that time, the imported pilots not only had no discounts, but also had a decoration of 20,000 to 40,000 in disguise. It was not a little less. I was resolutely resisting the price increase of the car. No matter any car, this was principles!Coupled with many car reviewers, the online reporters revealed that the pilot is about to be domestically produced, so I decided to wait for 2020 to talk about it!With the relief of the domestic epidemic, the operating status of its own company has gradually recovered, and everything in China is recovering.Domestic flyers also arrived in the second half of the year, waiting for the price to be announced!Then I started my tangled journey ------ first tangled the funny of the pre-sale price, then tangled different versions of configuration, and then tangled the difference between imports and domestic products, and then tangled Changan's quality control.I drove 3 times!The pilot caused greatly, and I had a long -term struggle with the 4S shop. Hehe, the great man once said that fighting with others is endless.At the beginning of the price, not only did there not be discounts, but also to buy 20,000 decoration; later said that the decoration can be less, and finally said that it can not be decorated.When you are about to start, you can see several car owners of the forum that have reported the import version of the imported version and the quality complaints of the domestic version.There is a problem with the car that is not terrible. The terrible thing is that Lincoln manufacturers have a handling attitude and a way of doing things.On the one hand, it is advertising, test car reviews, and water arms to advocate the so -called Lincoln luxury. On the other hand, it is a push for the owner of the problem.So entangled to come to me to drink tea again!Otherwise, look at Q7?IntersectionAfter all, it is BBA, and the brand and quality of mouth are good.Then I went to the Q7 again and talked about the price!I still have old habits. On the same day, I went to the Q7 and pilots respectively.How to say, if the pilot and discovery are compared, the two are distinctive!Then the comparison with the Q7 is not particularly obvious. Both focus on the road.I was originally tangled in the forum, thinking that it is still a pilot, but when I wait for at least half a year to buy it, it is not mainly expected whether the price will be discount, but how much it will focus on the quality of the domestic version.How to perform.However, it is such a strange fate. I have a friend and his classmates who are doing the business of a second -class car dealer. When I heard that I want to buy a car, I directly killed my office and gave it to him in one sentence.Yunyun!Hurrying, I was dumbfounded ------ I haven't agreed yet.Here is 10,000 words. In short, the pilot bought.What everyone wants to know should be the following: the administrative version of the domestic flyer, deep blue, there is no discount, send 5 times of maintenance, electrical steps, films, recorders and Lincoln small gifts.Think about it, my friends still have to give it, and I really like this car, buy it early and enjoy it early!### Flyinger",

The family is old and goes to my hometown to the provincial capital. The journey is far away.EssenceBefore buying, I also did some homework on the Internet, and I knew that the Emperor compared a lot of cars.Because occasionally, I will return to my hometown.So at the beginning, it was biased towards SUV and four -wheel drive.Compared with Rong Fang, Qijun, Tanyue, Tiguan L, Volvo XC40, Forests, CRV, Haoying, URV, logo 5008, Blazers and other SUVs.Qijun classic four -wheel drive hanging models of the same level, but it has not been replaced for a long time, the technology is old, the new appearance and interior are good, but it is a three -cylinder machine.Tan Yue has good power, and the interior is OK, that is, we need to run at high speed with \"masks\".Tiguan L's space is good, and it is a bit old. I am not optimistic about domestic extended models.Volvo XC40 security interior is very meaningful, that is, the price is a bit super budget, the low power is three -cylinder, and the space is a bit small.The forests are all imported, durable and real, that is, there are few 4S shops and expensive accessories.The CRV space is good, the interior is average, and the \"big butt\" is not good -looking, four -wheel drive weak chicken.Hao Ying's local special car, there is no good feeling.The URV is five large, and the space is good and has a strong sense of technology.Sign 5008, the chassis is solid, that is, the layout of the French car is weird and not used to it.The pioneer space is good, the body is solid, the fuel consumption is high, and the cost of car use is a bit high.The space of Rongfang's new model has slightly reduced the space. The four-wheel drive of the DTV-4WD torque control can be achieved. The thermal efficiency of the dual spray engine is high, the fuel saving is durable, the cost of the car in the later period is also good.Integrate consideration to buy 2021 Rongfang 2.0L four -wheel drive noble version.There is no Toyota 4S shop in my small county. There are only two in the recent provincial capital. I ran back and forth for two days. Only one shop has a 2.0L four -wheel drive precious version of the car.The car was mentioned in three days.The model is the 2021 Rongfang 2.0 four -wheel drive. The price of the naked car is 220800 yuan, and the insurance is 5500 yuan. The price of the tail and the side steps has been changed at a price of 25,1099 yuan.Talk about the experience of vehicle use: In terms of power, 2.0L power can only be said to be enough, suitable for Buddhist driving.As long as it is willing to give the oil starting torque, it should be because the gearbox is a gear.The torque output of the self -absorbing vehicle is relatively backward, and I feel that it is above 3500 or more.The speed of more than 100 yards is slightly attenuated.Personal driving up to 130, the chassis is tight and stable than the previous generation, and the roll is not obvious.After walking several times, the climbing of the slope is slightly difficult to switch the motion mode and manual gear.The steep slope is slowed down when it goes downhill, which is more practical.This car is about 18 cm in the air -carried chassis, but the corner and the departure angle are relatively small, and it is easy to top.The four -wheel drive of the city's SUV is more driving safety, don't think about heavy off -road.Rongfang space is okay, I am 175 cm, adjust my own comfortable posture, and there are three fingers in the driving position.The co -pilot seat can only be adjusted back and forth, the seat is high, and the big man is easy to pinch.The background space is quite satisfactory, and the middle position is not very high.The trunk space is large, the bottom of the opening, you can easily install the children's walking cars, toys, and the large suitcase.Toyota's interior workmanship is relatively savvy, which is comparable to domestic cars.I can be said to be the top matching of the gasoline version, but I feel really worse than that of Mercedes -Benz A. The young ladies and sisters like it. This interior has retired from countless female drivers and men's wives.Both are eye -catching!In terms of workmanship, the central armrest texture is made up, but my hands are shaking left and right. The children often fall in love with lying on, and I am afraid that this will fall.In terms of configuration, it is said that the safety configuration is complete, the whole series is the same, and there are more airbags.L2 -level autonomous driving is more practical at high speed. You can relax the calf muscles, but the biggest problem of this autonomous driving is that after the speed of the car at the speed in front of the vehicle is slowed down, if you change the lane or the vehicle in front of you suddenly accelerate, you will suddenly suddenly suddenly suddenly.Acceleration, very abrupt, speed soaring speed, engine speed often rotates more than 4,000, CVT gearboxes cannot afford such speed.There is also the most wanted configuration to start and stop automatically.The vehicle sound insulation is average, with a ride of 3500 or more. After 80 yards, the engine noise statement has increased significantly.Below 80 yards is mainly tire noise.It is not recommended to make rain and eyebrows.After 120 yards of high -speed, it has slightly affected the communication of the main and co -pilot, and the front and rear rows.The rigidity of the body is not bad, and the potholes are not affecting the opening and closing of the door and trunk.Roughly count about 9 fuel consumption in the urban area. It is almost 7 at the high speed, which is more fuel -efficient.The highest one -time exponential oil consumption is 18, which is on the rural climbing section.The lowest out -of -one oil consumption is 5.6, which is a high -speed section with more downhills.Personally, I feel that from 65 to 80 is the most fuel -efficient speed.To sum up the advantages and disadvantages, the advantage is that this generation of honor is in terms of safety, chassis, four -wheel drive, engine, lightweight body, and improvement of autonomous driving. The overall level of the vehicle is better and there is no obvious short board.缺点就是在内饰（廉价感，硬塑料件多）、车机功能少，没有车机互联（反而最低配有）、远程智能（一汽丰田APP功能越更新越少，还时常崩溃）、动力、The space (slightly smaller than before the model) still needs to learn more about domestic cars.

At that time, there was a 3.0V6 engine in the phase, and the three major pieces of Japanese cars were not prone to problems.At first glance, this car feels that this car is enough for the man. The lady should be ugly about this car.When I bought the car, the car had run 140,000 kilometers. When the seller was testing driving, it felt that 3.0v6 was really easy to drive, brisk and smooth, and it was not like a two -ton car.Although it is broken, I want this car with one heart, and the car is not easy to find near the door. I didn't think about it when I met one. I just wanted to have it.I don't know if riders have that kind of feeling.Anyway, the magic was stunned at the time, and it must be mine.Alas, the facts prove that the impulse is the devil, this is the last word!Payment, pick -up, and a set of procedures must be gone. When the file is pushed up, the battery is hung up. It is just that the auto repair city can be changed to the battery.When I stopped and waited for the traffic lights, it turned out to be a pan. Is this a single -cylinder tractor?Oh my god, but on the bad road, I have paid the money, I have to find it if I want to retreat.The air conditioner did not dare to open the windows in the summer and drove away, slowly boiled into the vehicle management office, mentioned the file and hurried to run to the high speed. After the car ran up, he didn't know what to do at the time.After returning home, take a serious look at the small problems in the car: 1. The purse of the steering wheel is rotten.2. After the steering wheel speaker is changed, it is cooler, and the airbags are bursting.3. Fall off the big top, fall off the back corner of the back row.4. The position of the four -wheel drive knob of the armrest box is raised.5. The air -conditioning wind turbine is seriously abnormal.6. The electric button moved before and after the main driver's seat is lost.7. The front windshield has changed to see the glue that is re -hit.8. The plastic lining of the trunk linked off the abnormal noise.9. The backup box gas rod is basically hung.10. It is easy to open the pan when it is short -distance, and it is not refrigerated with the air conditioner.11. Sometimes the direction of the hit will be stunned, and there is also a problem with the chassis.12. The rear wheels squeak.These problems were discovered by yourself, and then drove to the car repair shop to clean up.The above 10 problems are still small, solved one by one, when the steering wheel is covered, the boss said, \"Your airbag is bursting, it is an accident car.\" When my expression is: laughing and crying, you have to do it yourself, you have to do yourself yourself.by.The repaired boss said, \"The heat dissipation fan has been changed, the radiator has been changed, and the accident car is undoubted. It is estimated that the engine is not good.\"I have n’t seen the chassis, I hope there are any problems.The boss said to see it on the shelves. As soon as he put on the foreskin, he thought of the closer BGM: It's over, BBQ, finished the calf.The engine was severely oily, the oil bottom shell deforms, and the screws of the oil replacement are still sticky.At this time, the boss came with a phrase: \"Japanese cars leak oil, and you win the car with a lot of toss.\" \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\"It's not very good, I may keep repairing it.\" I wiped it. I really wanted to explode. I am not entering the pit and stepping on the mine. I am buried alive.Xiaobai must be cautious in the second -hand cars, then repair it. When I bought it, I was hospitalized before I entered the house. This one was still more than a week.It is the main repair of the engine leakage oil, and the accessories of the front wheel chassis can be replaced to solve the problem of steering. By the way, it solves the minor problems mentioned earlier.After a week of overwhelming car repair, I went to the store to pick up the car.The boss said that the problem of oil leakage in the car may not be able to solve the oil seepage, but it will not be leaked on the bottom or the middle shell. It may leak on it.In a word, I scattered the excitement of picking up my car. Will it be driven?Go, pay the key to drive home, go back on the road.Don't talk nonsense, that is, Shun, V6's machine sounds very strong and feel that you do n’t have much to force the car. Love this sound.But the sound insulation of this car is really bad, so worse and worse. In addition to the sound of V6, there are wind noise noise. You communicate with a speed of one hundred and two. As long as you drive this car, my wife does not bring me to me.In a word, I can't hear it clearly.However, the chassis is very thick. Although the chassis of the car is loose, it can feel very thick.However, I found that when the traffic lights were waiting for the red and green lights, I still opened a high temperature and alarm. The evil door was not repaired.I went back to the shop to find the boss. The boss said that it shouldn't be, and the idle speed was fine. The fan also turned.After a few days, I was holding a car. When I checked the oil, I felt that there was the wind blowing my legs. Isn't it right? Isn't the fan blowing off the cabin? How can I blow it out?I tried a note, sister, the two fans were blowing out of the outside, and the one was blowing inside, which was really interesting.Then I went back to the store to change the wiring before tossing this hair disease.Alas, suddenly felt that I was almost half a master after buying this car.But it is quite happy. It makes me know a lot of car knowledge, and I also realize that Taobao is really universal, what to do.It opened for four months.This was not two days ago that the engine leaked the anti -frozen liquid, which was leaked from the bottom of the valve room. The condenser in front was also leaked.This time it has to be demolished and demolished the engine.After a full week of repairs, I packed the chassis during the period, and changed all the plastic covers behind (the Taobao goods were about not changed), and the ternary catalyst was also installed (the hair was not used, the fault lights were bright, fake, fake, fake) The boss still said that day when the car was discharged.I really want to change its impulse this time. After all, there is always a problem with the problem that it really delays things, and this day is not fuel efficient.However, there is no new Xinyi goal for the time being.This is my second -hand Outlander experience. On this platform, the car dealer who sells my car, which is lying, said too much, he probably believes it.Believe you a ghost.#💔 💔 💔 ### 💔 (imported)",

     "text": "Immediately after 30 years old, ordinary city families, state -owned enterprises in the fifth -tier city.This year, there is a cute daughter. The work city is different from the provinces as her own and her lover's parents. The cause of the epidemic is no longer convenient. The commuting car on the weekend becomes a semi -rigid need, so I want to buy a car for steps.First, I watched Geely's new Emperor, BYD Qin hybrid.In fact, I still like Qin DMI.Although I can buy it, I still want to leave more money in my hand, after all, I have to start raising children.Lovers do not like domestic production, so they are chosen in the joint venture.I forgot how I chose Koruzer. I chose to choose to find that Kulze was only 80,000 yuan, which was 10,000 cheaper than Yinglang, and it came for cost performance.The price of the car was increased at 80,000.I have a loan, credit loan, no green book, no handling fee.Naked car 72900 down payment 31900 loans 41,000 18 months.Insurance 2850.On the card 120.Mailing 30.The worst is the purchase tax, 6300.I issued an invoice on May 15.Half a month later, you can save 3,000.Because Shenyang had 2,000 yuan in car purchase subsidies in May, the invoice was issued less than 2,000.The purchase tax did not take advantage of it, it was lost to explosion, and for several days.The foot pad was sent to the film armor.At present, this price may not have a reference significance, after all, the purchase tax is halved.In fact, I studied 2 weeks, and I found 7 stores on 5 cities online.The one who went to the lowest quotation was not cut.I bought the city next door, the cause of the epidemic, drove alone to pay the money to handle the money.The car is placed in the 4S shop, and sold to the sheets, armor, and foot pads sold.Film, I didn't post it.The card I went to the second week, it took 120 yuan for myself.By the way, the previously mailing license plate is 30 yuan.The card is still relatively twists and turns. At the beginning, the Shenyang vehicle management office, which was available at the beginning, could only be imported and tram.The first -level service station that goes to another will be finished quickly and one hour.The license plate is charged 80 yuan, voluntary, I didn't want it.It is said that the power is weak at 1:5. I drove the Buddha's department. I think it is okay. I do n’t feel back, but I also leave the oil. I do n’t feel how slow.The start is a bit slow, and the city road is a bit frustrated.High -speed 120 does not float, no longer open, follow the discipline and law.And have to run in.Because I use more at high speed, I feel that it is okay to overtake at high speeds, and the accelerator is OK.It is not serious about smashing and turning, maybe I ’m not fast, around 60.The chassis is solid, the road feels very comfortable, and it is very stable at high speed.Turning is normal, I think it is no different from the car I had drove before. Maybe I have no request about splitting.I am 1.75 meters tall and weighs 147 catties.The seats cannot be lowered. I am used to sitting high and a good vision.So it feels a little short, but does not delay driving.Consider whether to add a pad.At this price, the space in the car is definitely enough.The legs of the rear seat are 1 punch and half to 2 punch, and the head has 1 punch space.The trunk is quite large and can be enlargeable for about 5 boxes of liquor, which is the kind of 1 box and 6 bottles.80,000 yuan, speed cruise, LED automatic headlights, multi -function steering wheels, and the vehicle is okay. Understand the tutorial of the Emperor of the car. It has been promoted to Gaode Navigation 6.0. It is very easy to use. The original navigation is not good.Call, you are so Xiaoxue, and then shout, when you first see the moon on the banks, you can turn on wifi and even mobile phones.Give 100 G traffic each year.But without Angele Star, the vehicle cannot be controlled remotely.Fixed speed cruise is easy to use, and it is really cool to turn on high speed.I feel that the configuration is very good, but there is no one -click start and automatic handbrake.But after all, it is 80,000 yuan.There is no one -click rising window. I don't use one -click to raise the window, and I feel that it is not just right.The most dissatisfied is the interior. The color is too stupid. Give a plan. The color of the double spelling is yellow. It is not too old. It is too old. Give a full black interior, and the sales can still rise.The steering wheel should be leather, and it feels hard.I bought a leather case at 58 yuan myself, and my hand was stitched for 2 days, and it was finished for more than 4 hours. It was too tired, but it was also very fulfilled.The steering wheel is slightly sinking at a high speed, and the direction of repair must be used, but it feels very practical.It is okay to drive the comfort, and the two and a half hours of high speed will not be very tired.More than 200 kilometers.The sound insulation is okay, a little noisy at high speed.But it does not affect the communication of the main co -pilot and the front and rear rows.Although I also drive alone.Generally, music is usually played.It feels okay.Before the fuel consumption came out, I ran 760 kilometers.The average display is 5:99.The mailbox is too small, 44L.High -speed can run to show 5 oils.The urban table seems to be 8,9.I consumed the bear oil, and the average fuel consumption was 8:36, which showed 5:99.Is it a bit too happy?It was still a little bear.See if the first insurance can be low.The screen and hanging on the table are very easy to scrape. There is dust in the car, and the model of the hand is scratch. If there is obsessive -compulsive disorder, you must pay attention when you pick up the car and touch less.I bought the membrane, but I didn't notice that I had scratched myself after picking up the car, but I couldn't see it after the film.The biggest advantage is that it is very cost -effective. The joint venture cost -effective ceiling. The appearance of good appearance is still available, mainly cheap, too fragrant.It is very suitable for Gu Jia science and engineering men who want to worry about.Finally, thanks to the PSA drifting circle, the owner is recommended.### Kurosawa",

     "text": "#背 [Buy car background] After graduating from college for nearly 10 years, Hongqi H9 is my second car. The first car is the Beijing Hyundai IX35 SUV. After more than 6 years, I think about it.EssenceCompared with many cars, such as Cadillac CT6, Jaguar XFL, Audi A6L, Volvo S90, etc., in the end, I chose the Red Flag H9 for the face value.In terms of face value, H9 is still very capable, domineering front face, as well as slippery back shape, as well as long car lengths, under the direct sunlight, it is particularly handsome.In these comparison models, H9 is the longest. I especially like cars with long body, which gives people a particularly calm and luxurious.After testing, the experience feels similar to the Audi A6L. After all, it is a car from a group. The accelerator response quickly and the steering wheel very light.It is still very easy to be a car on the road, and the speed is up, and the engine speed is not high.Although the interior is not very fashionable, it is already very good compared to several other cars.In addition, many people say that H9 has high fuel consumption, and I feel that such people do not understand the car.The fuel consumption depends on the self -respect of the car, the driving conditions, and the driving habits of the driving habits. A two -ton+car will first have a low fuel consumption.In the case of violent driving, 9-12 oils are normal.This fuel consumption is not high. [Price sharing] I work in Nanjing now. I have been working in Hangzhou in the past few years, so the first choice cities for car purchase must be Nanjing.Nanjing talked about two stores, and finally talked about one, and paid the deposit that day.But one week before the car was picked up, I drove the old car to evaluate the price. Finally, because the price did not talk, I decisively chose to refund, and turned to contact the Hangzhou Red Flag 4S shop.It's right.I am doing things very quickly, I don't like being rushed, I don't like to grind.I booked a car on 2022.8.1, the price given by Hangzhou is 22 flags, and all subcontract (regional cards) landed 325,000 (including 15,000 replacement subsidies, insurance 7200, purchase tax 13200, license 0, handling fee 0)EssenceThe landing price of 32.5W was the price I reported. At that time, the price also reached my psychological expectations anyway, so it was determined directly.If 32.5W can't be landed, I may not consider it.When you buy a car and cut the price, just remember it. If you cut it in your heart, the expected price is determined. Do n’t always think about the lowest. Someone will always be lower than you. It is not necessary.[Experience Sharing] If you need to buy a car, you must run a few more stores and learn about the market online.A few months before I bought a car, I registered the Emperor of the Car. I still have a lot of posts worthy of everyone on the Emperor of the Che Emperor. Ask the riders' feelings.Of course, the most important thing is to go to the store for a test drive experience.Many posts seen on the Internet also have a certain amount of moisture, and must have the ability to recognize.Don't listen to the wind, it is rain, don't be partial.Before buying a car, many people on the Internet have various small problems with H9. I also have a try attitude. However, unfortunately, I basically have not encountered any problems. [Static first experience] The space is large!It's big!Very big!How big is it?There are more than 200 pounds of people who sit in, and there is no problem at all, whether it is the front or the back row.The back row experience is better and more comfortable.When the new car arrives, the car tastes very small, much better than the car I before.In terms of workmanship, I think it's okay, not exquisite, but not bad.Talking about the storage space, there are more people who talk about it. There is no place in the front row mobile phones. The cup holder is not very easy to put. You can only put the wireless charging in the armrest box, a bit of a chicken rib.When it comes to wireless charging, you must talk about it, the charging is slow, and the hot -which are very hot. I think the space is OK. I use it myself, and it feels more than enough.A large luggage, putting a few more bags, there is no pressure at all.[Dynamic first experience] The power is strong, the throttle response is rapid, the overtaking is easy, the high speed is easy to go to 140, there is no pressure, and the posture is very stable.However, the wind is dry, and after 120-130, the wind is dry, and the overall feeling is okay.The ramp is open to seventy or eighty to the vialogue, and the control is not lost in the BBA.There is a slight jitter at low speed, which may be a common problem for all dual -clutch transmission. I think it is acceptable.In terms of comprehensive fuel consumption, I have run more than 6,000 kilometers now, with a comprehensive fuel consumption of about 9.[Summary of advantages and disadvantages] The advantages are obviously more disadvantaged. There is no doubt that when the light is not good, when there is pedestrians in front, the car will have alarm prompt sound, which is very friendly.When the car is too close and the collision is about to occur, the car will also drop, and it will also prompt you to step on the brakes. If you do not step on the brakes in time, the system will take the initiative to intervene.In addition, the car is very hard. The car was accidentally rushed to Mazda in the back two days ago. Finally, I found that my car did not even leave the car paint.When I broke it, I really wanted to laugh and summarize. The car was driving for more than 6,000 kilometers, and the overall experience exceeded expectations.Although there are some details, this does not affect much, and I think it can be accepted.I hope this post can help the riders who are about to buy a car.### Red Flag H9",

As a result, many people had a lot of questions about the car of the explorers.The most real owner of the explorer, I really have something to say, I am 19 1.5T -control models mentioned in January 19 years. At present, my explorers have run for 2 years and 5 months.I ran more than 40,800 kilometers. Overall, I feel that I want to say these mileage and use time.40862 kilometers 1. Regarding the fuel consumption of the explorer, I mainly drive the daughter -in -law every week with Shenyang urban areas or lightly cross Homoyo with other off -road riders (there are also light wearing videos in my personal forum).The district has never reached the double digits between 7-9 and can be between 5-6 at high speed.2. Regarding the control and motivation of the explorer, the direction can be said to be accurate first, and there is no extraction in the direction.Regarding motivation, my exploration 1.5T model controlling version (National 5) has not worried about this motivation. Whether it is mud/steep slope/high -speed/violent driving, it can be fully competent.Exploring the Kuron Liaohe River in the Five Girls Mountain in the construction site 3. Regarding the face value, many people say that the appearance of the exploration is okay, but the interior is really bad. I really want to say that the appearance and interior of the exploration areThe first choice to move me. If you don't feel good -looking, I can only say that this may be difficult to adjust. First of all, the appearance of the 19 models of 19 models and tough guys is really handsome (only for me), especially the headlights.When I first looked at it, I thought it was Land Rover.I don't feel so ugly or cheap about the interior. First of all, I use a word to describe my perception of this interior. It is simple but not simple.What you see is a cheap plastic feeling (Isn't slush plastic plastic? And the cost of slush plastic is much lower than the hard plastic cost, and it is easy to deform. Is it not cheap to fake hair? For me, it is a relatively low auto parts.Wind) Explore the gas field. 4. Regarding the thick and thin places of the exploration, the central armrest box is covered with independent items and placed the reserved seat.The main and auxiliary door umbrella placed grid (I really like this small design too much. The wet umbrella on the rainy day is directly stuffed in the mouth of the umbrella.This is also very demand for me. Weighing air pumps and outdoor electricity. You do n’t have to worry about electricity lying in the trunk 5. About the intelligence of exploring, no need to say on Anshisa (including air conditioning)Remote unlocking, remote turnover, vehicle positioning, vehicle condition query) I often use these.Carplay function, my favorite navigation/song/weather query, etc.Detective lock automobile automatic lock function This is very nice. Now my key has been in the pocket. At present, I said so much first. Some friends may say that you have not drove other cars. These cars have these functions.Yes, but I am going to talk about it. At present, I have an Audi TT in addition to the exploration. If I let me compare these two cars, I can say that I love to drive too much. First of allI usually like to go out and play, a bunch of equipment, TT can't let go at all, sometimes friends can get a car again, except for the co -driver can sit one person, basically can't sit back). Secondly, TT is not able to say it except the power, but I personally feel that the details I feel slightly slightly slightly slightly slightly.There is an embarrassing USB interface. My daughter -in -law and I have changed the charging. There are the most important TT overlap bands, or the small potholes can be described as \"咣 咣\".TT is no longer the minds.Some people say that the explorers started and stopped. My TT also brought start and stop. When my family chose to explore, I only considered the explorer, Mercedes -Benz GLB, and Audi Q3.There is more than a full rubbing (considering the post -car maintenance, daily vehicle expenses, etc.), it can be said that this exploration is also completely true of my personal property, and I did not rely on any family.Thank you for your companionship with me and witnessing my growth.

The insurance was more than 3,000 and landed by 290,000.In January 2020, the car was lifted for more than 8,000 kilometers.

The lane deviates from the auxiliary, and it is only enabled by more than 70 kilometers. When the road is near the road, the steering wheel vibrates left and right.

There are actually discounts, and everyone understands.There is also a discount of specific large customer companies in the store, depending on personal circumstances.Gifts: foot pads, trunk pads, first guarantee, one basic maintenance, sunscreen film.The sun protection film was not required, and it was added for 3M.The new car is 10 kilometers, and it has been driving more than 1,000 in 2 and a half months. The driving is not fiercely compared with the Buddhist department. The urban circuit is basically a speed limit run. The urban area is comprehensive. The comprehensive fuel consumption is 6.5.About 0.5 yuan/km.There are fewer cars and less experiences.The previous driving was Jingrui 1.4 manual, more than 70,000 kilometers in 10 years.I feel that this car is fast and friendly.At present, the airport high -speed is running at most, which is about 110. The sound insulation is okay. It is not too obvious. It is much better than Jing Rui anyway.Speed ​​up daily speed is enough.There are still taste in the car. Although it is not pungent, it still needs to be opened frequently. Although it is okay in autumn and winter, it is estimated to be more obvious after summer exposure.When driving, the abnormal noise in the instrument panel is not heard.The second gear is a bit blunt when the second gear; the sixth gear retreats and the fifth gear are sometimes easy to hang into the four gears. It may have something to do with the six -gear car before.Except for the slight frustration when the second gear drops, the other gear basically does not have a sense of frustration.The sound was loud at starting startup, but the time was short. Within about 1 minute, the engine was stable, and the idle speed dropped to less than 1000 rpm.It is also very convenient to turn off the fire and start again.The time of glass and tires is relatively new, and the manual transmission car does not have an inventory car.At present, the exhaust pipe is relatively clean, without black and gray, and it is also rowed.It's a niche, so I haven't encountered it on the road once.Several small feelings: 1. After the long parking for a long time, the SD card cannot be identified. It is no problem to read the U disk. It may be related to the low temperature outside the car. This is also the case.2. The volume of the car music feels that it increases with the increase. I wonder if this is actually the case.3. The steering wheel is relatively light, and it feels that there is no worse change after the speed of the vehicle.4. The second half of the brake is relatively soft. Indeed, some netizens feel \"unreasonable\"; the first half is okay.5. Mobile Bluetooth connecting vehicles to play music quality is really not good, and the volume adjustment effect is not good. It is not recommended.6. After watching the prompt of the car display screen in the group, I hurriedly pasted one, but it was really not easy to post.The display is uneven and it is difficult to stick.7. The rear space is small, the cushion is short, the back is straight, and the trunk is not too large.However, after the seat is put on, it is relatively flat, and it is more convenient to pull things.8. The fuel consumption on the left side of the middle screen on the dashboard shows the triangular shape arrows on the columnic diagram, showing the average fuel consumption value.Floating pointers on the column chart show instantaneous fuel consumption.You can clearly see your current fuel consumption level and the comparison of average fuel consumption.9. The Huawei mobile phones are played directly with mobile phones. Carplay and carlife have never been used.

Installed an original car driving recorder of the original car, the shell on the rearview mirror was removed, and it fits the original car. It is running along the door of the door. There is no exposed wire and is relatively neat.11. The steering wheel is made of slush and it feels a bit slippery. It is equipped with a cortical steering wheel cover, which is a rough circle.It is not recommended to install it by yourself, the positioning is very hard, it is easy to suture it yourself, it is time -consuming and labor -intensive, and the professional things are better to professional people to do better.12. I bought a special mobile phone stand for a special car. Although it needs to be sticking to the instrument platform, it feels okay, and the bonding area is not too large.13. When the temperature of the air conditioner is at a high temperature position, when the warm air is turned on, it does not enable it from the start and stop.

I was attracted by its appearance and power. I came to understand the evaluation, videos or articles about GX almost every day.This also makes me believe that this car is what I want.From paying attention to it to owning it, I have not considered other models at the same price, and finally ended a year of waiting last month.First of all, let's talk about the advantages. The appearance is very sporty. This car belongs to that kind of look -resistant model. The front face and sideways are not bad. The buttocks are slightly high.Mi Chang's body is displayed. If the waistline is tied and the buttocks are low, the absolute explosion.The internal configuration of the car can be said to be enough daily, tire pressure monitoring, one -click startup, reversing image, automatic parking, electronic handbrake, fixed speed cruise, etc. It is very practical. 65%of the interior uses cortex wrapping. The central control retains some mechanical machinery.The keys and air -conditioning knobs, with the three large screens to reflect a full sense of technology; the seats are made of imitation skin, and the softness and wrapping are very good. The horizontal space of 1825 and the wheelbase of 2670 are also very sufficient.At the middle and upper levels; the space of the trunk is also very large, and an adult of 1.8 meters can be lying on the side without crowded. Finally, I want to talk about the motivation I am most concerned about. This model uses 1.5T turbineThe supercharged engine can simulate the CVT gearbox that can simulate the ninth gear, so that it can erupt the maximum 230N and 156 horsepower. Daily driving has two modes of ECO and Sport. It is also necessary to push back!The tire matching tires of the original car is a tire of 205/50r17. I replaced the tire of 225/45R17 two days after the car.Full), the ECO mode is sufficient to use daily driving, and the accelerator response is slightly delayed, but the response to the Sport throttle is very positive and there is no delay.When the fuel consumption was lifted, 12 oils were just increased. After running a few days, it dropped to 9.5, and then ran to 7.2 at a high speed. At present, it is 7.7. If it is the original tire, it should be low.If you have to say the shortcomings, it is the hard shock absorption, but this is also the characteristic of this car. The bias of chassis tuning is biased, but I personally do not care about the shock absorption.As for the various abnormal sounds that riders said, it has not yet been found; there is also the sound insulation effect of this car is not so good, but it is worthy of this price.Some people say that the car is the second wife for a man. In my opinion, it is more like a brother who fights side by side with you. No matter where you are, no matter how late you are, it is waiting for you.When you are tired, it will open your arms to greet you. In this narrow space, you will find your own world.In recent years, our domestic cars have really been improving.

The driving is particularly stable, and I will never give up.For ten years, get married and have children, and with a second child, my little Yinglang space is obviously not enough. Every time I leave the door, I have to be large and small. The space for four people in one car is too crowded., I am determined to add another car, so I started my car purchase journey. The space required that the space should be large, the back box can be installed, the vision must be wide, the power must be strong, the configuration must be higher, the car must be driven, and the car will be driven.To be stable, the budget is best controlled within 25W.[Selection and purchase process] During the period, I saw a lot of brands, Tiguan L, Tan Yue, XT5, Ruijie, etc., there were all the eyes, and my eyes were spent.Tiguan L. Tan Yue also went to the store to see it. The appearance is okay. The central control multimedia screen is large enough. Others, the plastic is full, there is no highlight, plus the granular cable problem, so basically do not consider it, know how to know how to know howUnderstand, don't be afraid of 10,000 just in case.In the Ruijie, the old discontinued production, the new Ruijie L had no samples and no price when I went to the four sons shops at the time, and the car had basically selected the car after the price came out.XT5, in fact, I really like it, I really like it, I also go to test drive. It is steady and the space is large enough. That is, the China -Control Multimedia screen is too old. If you want to buy it, you want to choose a four -wheel drive hummingbird. Unfortunately, it ’s a pity.The price is greatly exceeded. If you want to get in his early 30s, you can only give up temporarily.Finally, talk about Angkow Plus. In fact, I have paid attention to it very early. The price is much cheaper than XT5, and the configuration is still higher. Streaming media rearview mirrors, 360 images, electric tail doors, etc.Models that can be available.After a test drive, the high brakes said by netizens. This problem is true, but maybe I am tall and big. Within the scope of my acceptance, as for the AT gearbox, I do n’t think it ’s a problem. I do n’t think this is a problem.Let's get used to it.[Price Sharing] The car was selected, then the price started to kill. At first, there were 23 models that started to talk about sales. The first four sons shop was priced at 23. I did n’t talk about the price.The price is 22.7, while the price cannot be overwhelmed, I heard that there are 22 existing cars in the store during the chat, and the price is more than 23 discounts. If the difference, a co -pilot electric adjustment will be manually regulated.After adjusting it, I won't move it more, so I started a long process of bargaining ... Here is the result of omitting 500+ characters, the last saying the price result, 22 Ang Kuwei Plus652T luxury version, the production date of 22 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years 10 years.On the 30th, the five -month -old car was barely within the acceptable range. The naked car was 20.04, and the landing was 22.18. The insurance had 3 million commercial insurance from the insurance manufacturer. The premium was 2300 and the purchase tax was 17,000+.If you give the gift, you do n’t give it out. The film and driving recorder and the manufacturer have been maintained twice.[Space layout and workmanship] Space: The British than me is large enough. After all, as a medium -sized SUV of a large and five -seater, the spacious performance of the car is also basically performed.I am 180, the main driving adjusts the comfortable position, and the back row space is still empty.The trunk is also large enough. I no longer use a family to go out more luggage. I bought a storage box on the Internet to facilitate the storage of zero crushed.Workingman: How do you say it, you can only say that it can be acceptable. It is quite satisfactory, it is not luxurious, and there is no coolness. The interior is not exaggerated. It is in line with the characteristics of the household car.The so -called piano paint is too easy to leave scratches.Of course, I don't like flowers around. I think the interior style of my eyes will not be outdated in a few years.[Dynamic level and control stability] The new car does not pull high speed. Anyway, as long as it is appropriately given oil, 120 is easily, and the power performance of the 2.0 turbocharged engine will be excited.But if you have to pay attention to driving, you will be afraid of the off -speed fined.The 120 -yard speed car is still very stable, that is, a bit bumpy. I do n’t know if it is the reason why the new tire pressed was too high. The tire pressure of the cold car 296 was ready to remove a little gas.Although the size of the vehicle is large, there is no feeling of bulky. Regardless of conventional operations such as the speed of turning and variable channels, I can be handy. The performance of the chassis also makes me feel good stability. Occasionally, when the uneven road surface, the comfort of the ride is still maintained still.Not bad.At present, the comprehensive fuel consumption is 9.4, the new car is full of battery life 705 kilometers, less than 200 kilometers, and 695 battery life. Visually, a box of oil is 700 kilometers.[Summary] There is no one person, there is no car for a car, you can only adapt to the advantages and disadvantages of a car after buying a car, otherwise don't buy or only sell it.As long as there are no problems in the three major pieces, a little bit of little hair can be reluctant to accept it. Of course, there is no problem that is the best.Finally, thank you for the recommendation of the Huizhou man!### Ang Kewei",

     "text": "One of the engineers ~~ Ready to change the car at the end of the year. The old car is Harvard H6 manual (currently 185,000 kilometers), and Japanese cars are not considered.Do not consider the tram because there are endurance anxiety.Usually it is more than 100 kilometers a day.At the beginning, Ang Keqi, Q3, X1 also had Hongqi HS5 and other domestic cars.The old car is domestically produced, and the daughter -in -law said she wanted to change the joint venture (not patriotic ...).I didn't pay attention.Ang Keqi has to be booked without the existing car, and the price is a bit tense, Q3 is too small (I am 185), the red flag is a bit officially, and many friends are red flags, so ...When I saw Lincoln on Douyin, I went to understand the Emperor Chalinke.At first I looked at Z, so I took my daughter -in -law to see the car at the 4S shop.It was attracted. After considering that for a while, I felt that Dalian screen was not applicable. Too many failure rates of electronic configuration would be high, and it would be embarrassing to throw half of it if you had a problem.Instead, I went to see the adventurer.Maybe this is the opportunity![Comparison process of choosing a car] Originally, I chose Angke Banner.If there are no preferences in all aspects of the car, the price will be much better.There is no way to give up; Audi Q3 has been opened before, but the space is too small, and many aspects are optional.There is no way to BBA is hard.BMW X1, the daughter -in -law looked good, but went to the 4S shop and tried it. The space was average.It feels like a big size or a two -box sedan.It's really not good.[Car purchase price] There is a shop in Handan, and it can only be talked about.Originally, a friend was there, and I felt that it was worthless.They are all at work, and the rights in their hands are limited, why find this trouble.Two talks may be near the Spring Festival. It ’s hard to talk, and the price is very tight.The price of two -wheel drive Zunya will not come down when it comes to 24.5 (we can't do it), and then the gift, the foot pad, the membrane (not, the film is not good for the driving recorder), the air frying pot, six timesMaintenance (don't send it for nothing, we still know the way of knowing it is basic maintenance, they are all learned by Emi Lili) and other miscellaneous gifts.When the insurance talks, it is said that it is not forced to buy it in the store. When you go to the insurance, you must buy it in the store. You must buy it in the store. When you talk about it, you say that you must buy it in the store in the first year, and I am very disgusted.Because they all told their classmates (he is the manager of the PICC, there are many discounts).There is no way to get this step, then buy 7000.Finally, the purchase tax, half of the manufacturer subsidies.Retreat in the second month.The installment is short loan.[Vehicle workmanship] The vehicle workmanship is very good because it is a US car.It is impossible to be compact, and it will be more perfect under the details of domesticization.After an example, the windshift pipe of the windshield is exposed. Once there is a damaged back box, it is a connection man!And it is not beautiful, my little 6 is invisible.Later, when the wind glass water pipe is the same, [odor] The new car did not find a odor, or the sequelae after the sun may not smell it!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionHowever, the floor pad is a bit leather, but we have freshness and aromatherapy. If we ca n’t choose a treasure to buy bamboo charcoal, it can solve the drip.[Space] The space is not like a compact car. After I sit in, I do n’t feel crowded (unlike 3 cats), the back row is okay, and the back supports adjustment.However, there are two points. One is that the rear seats are a bit short, and it will be uncomfortable for a long time. The other is that the seat belt buckle is a bit stingy. It is recommended to sink a two centimeters ....... perfect.The trunk space is a bit, it ’s really better to install ...In the first row, the second row is the second row, then you can only sacrifice the trunk.The rear space of the trunk space [sound insulation treatment] From the comments of the car emperor, 80%of the adventurers chose the adventurer because of the quiet and neat sex of the car.I did a good job in sound insulation. The tire noise filtering was very good. I felt like 80 miles on the wind noise. I guess it was almost like this, after all, it was an SUV.Wind resistance is objective.Also, the engine sound is a bit obvious (personal feeling), but I like to listen to songs on the car, you can ignore it!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersection[Advantages] The configuration detailed configuration will not go into details. Knowing the car emperor (you can also see the car home and the car can be seen).In terms of power, the entire department is equipped with 2.0T245 horsepower.No different treatment, making people very comfortable.The point is that he still eats 92, surprise, no accident!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionThe front row seat heating seats are very practical. The old cars used to have seat heating, and I knew it.The unexpected surprise was that the steering wheel heating was also equipped with happiness.There is also a seat memory, comfortable in and out, and the sense of sense of welcoming is full (although I am a person who doesn't care about forms, there can be a little vanity).In terms of security, ACC, lanes maintained, anti -collision warnings, and reversing side warnings are indeed safe.Test it in person, better than simple fixed speed!Although more than ten years old, there are these more assured.The appearance is platinum diamond white, low -key without losing luxury.The model can only be benevolent, and wise men are wise!The front face [disadvantage] less than a month of test car, forced to say some disadvantages 1. High brakes, hard brakes, and short brake strokes are not convenient to control.Personally, it is okay, maybe driving for a long time?Generally, it is okay to adapt.2. Fuel consumption, there seems to be no fuel saving in 2.0T, no more than 13 oils are not expense (do not spray, only represent personal opinions).No need to see the fuel consumption of the computer, how many kilometers to run with a box of oil came out. I calculated it myself. The 1300 kilometers are currently 9.4.3. Sync+system, it's not easy to use, I can't use it here.4. Car navigation, such a luxurious car, I feel that using Gaode is perfect. It is not that Baidu map is not good. Its satellite map is still very useful.But daily navigation is not as good as Gaode.5. Automatically start and stop, this function is very controversial.Some people are willing to use it, and some people are disgusted, but forced opening is a tuning point.[Last summary] It's so much. In short, the adventurer's car corresponds to this price.As for what advantages and disadvantages, in a word, the car is driven by people.Do not let the car control people.Finally, thank you family, I wish you peace in 2023 and get rich!IntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionIntersectionPlease recommend to refine!Intersection###adventurer",
