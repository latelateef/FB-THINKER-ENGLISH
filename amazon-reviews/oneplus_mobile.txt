I bought this mobile (OnePlus Nord CE 3 Light 5 G) day before yesterday (12th Oct 2023). The phone which I received gets heated easily and battery is not lasting more than 3 hours. I raised this issue with Amazon and they asked me to avail replacement from Service Center, I visited Service Center but they refused to support. Again I connected with Amazon on this issue, they arranged a technician visit tomorrow (15th Oct 2023) and based on technician's investigation report, no one contacted during the scheduled timeframe, again called Amazon support team, they promised for the refund if I didn't get any response within 8 hours. But within 8 hours, I received an IVR call to get the confirmation on the denial of technician visit. I didn't give the consent for cancellation of visit. Despite of this, technician visit was rescheduled to next day. Next day, no one visited home, but someone called and asked us to download an application and he performed all the activities and submitted the report that the phone is fine, but on call he said that phone has battery issues and he will submit the report accordingly. But he didn't do this.

I again called Amazon support to know the further process of refund next day but surprisingly they denied for the refund and asked me to get in touch with service center. I asked them why you wasted 3 days of my warranty period which they had no answer.

But overall result is I have to suffer with the defective mobile as no one is taking ownership of this issue.

I would strongly recommend to everyone not to purchase any electronic device from Amazon.

One year post buying. Just an average phone. Display is not good, even in full brightness sometimes you feel there's something amiss. Battery life has degraded. Doesn't get through even 15 hours properly. Other phones in this price range will usually last over a day. Speed has worsened, now and then there are glitches while playing even small games. Camera is only proper in good lighting else it is a dud. Only pros are sound and touch quality .

Please dont by this phone, currently i am facing network detection issue after 1 year use,, when i checked so many r facing the same issue,, it will work fine in earlier days but once 1 year complete it start showing issues,, one plus doesnt have previous quality to its product

I'm writing this review after using this phone for 5 months and the battery of this phone is swollen. Before I was unaware and noticed just now... Read many reviews and few people claims it's due to overheating..... But in my case i believe I don't use my phone much.... Suppose even if I used .... Everyone knows the heating issue of Xiomi phone and my previous phone was of Xiomi the battery was never swollen nor in Infinix.... It's disappointing OnePlus having such a big game and serving their customers product like this..

I recently had the unfortunate experience of using a certain smartphone, and I must say it was an incredibly disappointing device. From the camera quality to the operating system, this phone fell short in every aspect, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied. Allow me to elaborate on my experience.

Let's start with the camera. It's hard to believe that in this day and age, a smartphone can have such a poor camera. The images captured with this phone were consistently grainy, lacked sharpness, and struggled with color accuracy. Even in well-lit environments, the camera failed to produce decent results. Whether it was capturing a scenic landscape or taking a simple selfie, the final output was always disappointing. If you enjoy taking high-quality photos or value a good camera on your phone, this is definitely not the device for you.

Moving on to the operating system, it was equally underwhelming. The phone ran on an outdated version of the operating system, lacking many of the features and optimizations found in modern smartphones. The user interface felt clunky, and navigating through the menus was a frustrating experience. I frequently encountered lag and slow response times, making even simple tasks feel like a chore. The app ecosystem was also limited, with several popular applications either unavailable or incompatible with the device. It was a constant reminder of the phone's outdated software and lack of support from the manufacturer.

Battery life was another major letdown. Despite claims of decent battery performance, this phone struggled to last through a full day of moderate usage. I found myself constantly searching for a charging outlet or carrying a power bank wherever I went. It's frustrating to have a phone that can't keep up with your daily needs and constantly requires recharging.

Furthermore, the build quality of the phone left much to be desired. The materials used felt cheap and plasticky, lacking the premium feel you would expect from a modern smartphone. The overall design was uninspiring, and the device felt bulky and uncomfortable to hold for extended periods.

In terms of value for money, this phone falls far short. Considering its price point, there are numerous alternatives on the market that offer superior camera quality, smoother performance, and more up-to-date software. It's difficult to justify spending hard-earned money on a phone that fails to deliver on the basic expectations of a smartphone in this day and age.

In conclusion, I strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this particular phone. Its poor camera quality, outdated operating system, disappointing battery life, and lackluster build quality make it an incredibly frustrating device to use. Save yourself the headache and explore other options that offer better features and overall user experience.

I’ve been using the OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite, and honestly, I’m not satisfied with it, especially considering the price. It feels like you’re paying an extra ₹2000 just for the OnePlus brand, when you could get a similar phone from Realme for much less.

The camera is quite disappointing, especially for indoor shots, and the video quality in low light is very poor. The processor is underwhelming—it often feels laggy, especially during multitasking, which is frustrating for a phone in this price range. After just six months, it’s started taking 3-4 seconds to unlock when I press the power button, which is concerning.

To make matters worse, the battery has degraded quickly. Initially, it would last two days, but now I’m struggling to get through even a single day. Overall, I wouldn’t recommend this phone—it just doesn’t offer the performance or quality you’d expect for the price.

it is a good looking phone but has quality issue, by applying slight pressure this phone bends, be carefull and open the box in front of the delivery driver, I got scammed by delivery boy and did not even recieve the phone in the box.

I am writting this review after using the phone for more than a year. My satisfaction level is quite high for this phone. The built of mobile is so good. Look wise it is quite trendy. Performance is excellent. Quality of camera is very good. It comes with a super chager. Charging time of the mobile is very less. Back up is nice. After all it's a crafted mobile. It's worth every penny you spent .
I have only small issues regarding the sound quality. When connected to bluetooth the sound is very low even at maximum volume.
I specifically want to mention about it's water resistance quality. 'Marvellous' is what I would like to mention about it's resistivity towards ingress of water. My mobile fell down in water and remained under water for nearly 6 hours. When recovered, I was surprised to see the mobile still working nicely. All parameters were fine. Only SIMs were out of order due to water ingress in the SIM slot. I dried it up with a air blower, inserted the SIM and they started working fine. There was no water ingress to any other parts of the mobile. The net connectivity was working fine.
This was a pleasant surprise to me. I have decided to buy only One plus for any future purchase. I highly recommend this.

I an using this mobile since one week, here are some pros and cons
Pros
Simple and best design
Smooth touch function
Finger touch response is good
Sound quality is good
Calling is good
Charging really fast (approx 35-40 min)
Cons;
Camera is not up to the mark
Notifications light /sound is missing.
Overall it's a good purchase at 15150

The OnePlus Nord CE 3 Lite 5G is a popular mid-range smartphone that balances affordability with some great features. Here’s a look at its unique pros and cons:
Pros:
1. Affordable 5G Access: One of the more affordable options for experiencing 5G on a OnePlus device, offering high-speed connectivity without a high price tag.
2. High-Refresh-Rate Display: Its 6.72-inch LCD display with a 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling, gaming, and general use feel smoother compared to standard 60Hz screens.
3. Good Battery Life: Comes with a 5,000mAh battery that can last a full day with typical use, along with 67W fast charging, which can get the phone to around 80% in just about 30 minutes.
4. Solid Primary Camera: The 108MP primary sensor performs well in good lighting, capturing clear and detailed images, which is impressive for this price range.
5. OnePlus Software: OxygenOS, OnePlus's custom skin, is known for being clean, smooth, and less cluttered compared to some other Android skins.

Cons:
1. LCD Screen Instead of OLED: Unlike some competitors, it has an LCD instead of an OLED display, so colors aren’t as vibrant, and blacks are not as deep.
2. Limited Processor: The Snapdragon 695 chip is decent but not very powerful. It may feel a bit sluggish with more intensive tasks or high-end gaming.
3. Average Low-Light Photography: The camera’s low-light performance isn’t great, which may lead to noisy or blurry photos in dim settings.

I had been using Samsung phone for years together in the past. Though it is also a good brand, recently I changed it to Oneplus nord CE 3 for the first time. It is really an awesome phone in terms of looks, performance and fast charging. Value for money

I am already using iphone from last 3 years. So I am sharing this review comparing this phone with it. I can say that it is equals to that in overall performance. Except camera. Because I don't use camera. But it is also decent in quality.
