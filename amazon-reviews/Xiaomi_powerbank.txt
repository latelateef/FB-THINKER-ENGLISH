Giving 5 star because review shows on top so others will be helped
This power bank was not up to the mark
I have used only one time battery has not fully charging after one use
Don't believe in this xiaomi power bank if you order you will definitely replace or refund the item.
When I bought this Powerbank, I didn't found a detailed review regarding this but now as I have used and tested this Powerbank (20000 mAh variant) for 7 days, so I think I'm eligible to write a detailed review for this. Mainly I will write this review based on 4 points, build quality, charging time of powerbank, charging speed and battery backup. So let's start.

1. Build Quality : The build quality of this Powerbank feels quite solid & nice. Its sandstone design texture and round edges makes its grip solid in hands & quite comfortable to hold. Before this I used to have Redmi Powerbank (20000 mAh) which in comparison to this Mi Powerbank feels little ugly in terms of design and uncomfortable to hold. Mi Powerbank feels less wider, thinner & more premium as compared to the previous one.
It is Too HEAVY its build quality is very good its charging phones fast but the weight it a red flag for me
I'm really impressed with the performance of this Mi power bank! It charges my devices quickly and efficiently, making it perfect for when I'm on the go. The build quality feels solid, and it holds a decent amount of charge. For the price, it offers excellent value, outperforming other power banks I've used in the past. Highly recommend this product if you're looking for something reliable with fast charging speed and great overall performance!
Charging speed is normal, there is no fast charging. If you forget about this fact, it's a good enough product having great capacity.
Charging cable not shipped with the product, otherwise the product is good my previous power bank was also purchsed from Amazon but unfirtunately I lost it
After ordering this for 1899/- it come to 1609/- And I cannot return it either. So if you get that in 1600 it‚Äôs good and you‚Äôll save money.
Showing 20000 mah capacity. But I used it and got just 15000 mah capacity.
Guys here they have mentioned power bank takes 4 hours time to fully charge, but when I kept for changing its has already 75% of charging and now, for 75% to 100% of charge it's takes 10 hours ( morning 10:33 am - evening 7:30 pm ) so I decided to return but there is no return option there is only have replacement option and i called to customer care for return and I got chance to return but I kept this power bank with me because compare to other brand and other power bank prices and duration of charging very poor so that compare to other this is better and very costly I'm not satisfied but there is no option I need power so I kept with me for emergency.
And it's not returnable. Look at the product specifications, and maybe pay a bit more for a better option that isn't so heavy and ugly. Otherwise it's money down the drain. I almost feel scammed.
The power bank only accepts charging via C, but support output only with USB-C (C-to-C cable not enabled).
It lacks a USB-A charging port, enabled only with C for charging.
To access the stored power, users must use a USB-C cable. ( C -C not enabled)
I have bought multiple Xiomi products but this is the worst. It's been 8 hrs and still this Power bank is not fully charged!!! Is this supposed to take that much of time!!!
I am asking the service center and they are saying, this is how it works! I mean really??? 8 hrs to charge this Power bank, which is still not charged yet.
Its heavy to handle and it doesn't even fast charge any Redmi product as it claims!!
VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!
	Dear Users,
i am using amazon from 2016, still they are edlivering useless product, please don't go with this Xiaomi power bank, i have ordered and replaced 3 times,
first time they delivered a dead one,
second time mobile charge was done only once 5000 mah battery,
third time i have kept this power bank on charges on 16th october 03:00PM today is 18th october 12:29 PM still its not fully charged, Looks like its power indicator is faulted),

finally i have returned all of them and moved to amazon basic power bank, as i have user that already previously more than 2 years and still its running, worst power bank is XIAOMI, dont waste your money....
This is very heavy and not handy but in advertisement it's mentioned that it is slim, which is not slim, it's quite bulky.So after purchase called call centre for replacement for 10000mAh which is light and slim. For which call centre simply denied. Very poor response to customer request.
