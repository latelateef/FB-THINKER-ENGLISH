I received my OnePlus device only four days ago, and unfortunately, one side of the device has already stopped working. When I attempted to return the device, I was informed that it could not be returned due to it being an open-box delivery. I was advised to contact the OnePlus repair center instead. I understand that open-box deliveries may have certain restrictions, but I believe that if a device stops working within the return period, it should still be eligible for return, refund, or replacement. I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter.
The ipods stopped working after using it for a couple of days ! Very poor quality
Not for long hour use my ears get hurt after wearing for long hour .. music is oky.. bass is bit high.. battery backup 5-6 hr.. I suggest don't buy this instead go for oneplus bullets anc same sound quality
This product has manufacturing defect and I am not comfortable with its adjustment in my ear. A bad quality in sound, design and build.
Terrible services in return policy, they will make any effort not to return this product.
So buy this product on your own perils.
Bad sound quality and poor bass. It is only good for calling. But after paying this price, poor sound quality cannot be accepted. You are charging based on Brand value. It has nothing special and valuable as per price as it was expected. According to price its value unjustifiable.
I would say the product quality is absolutely phenomenal, Below is the rating i would want to give on the features:
Sound Quality/Bass: 9/10
Battery-powered: 10/10
Noise Cancellation: 75%-80% accuracy
Instant Plug out(When you take off any side of buds): Absolutely Cool 10/10
Volume inc/dec: 9/10
Call pick up one/double tap: 10/10
Feels like the earbuds belongs to 12k to 20 k category
Gives competition for apple airpods

I am using this for my iphone and it works exceptionally ðŸ’¯
they have good bass, which makes the sound rich and powerful. I enjoy listening to music and podcasts with these earphones, as they deliver clear and crisp audio. they have a premium classy look, which makes them stylish and elegant. They fit well in my ears and are comfortable to wear. They also have a touch control feature that lets me adjust the volume, play/pause, and answer calls with a simple tap. Best ANC in the segment nothing comes near neither oppo nor realme. Best battery backup in the 5k range , nothing comes near. Go without any doubt.
(Nothing phone 1+ op buds 3)- supports lhdc

these are some of the things that I noticed

*Sound leak issue is there
*bass and clarity is not much as expected
*anc is working really well
*Touch Controls are so smooth
* Chance of getting scratches on the buds is high.
